%% Description: This function is called whenever an application 
%% is started using application:start/1,2, and should start the processes
%% of the application. If the application is structured according to the
%% OTP design principles as a supervision Tree, this means starting the
%% top supervisor of the tree.

%% Function: stop(State) -> void()
%% Description: This function is called whenever an application
%% has stopped. It is intended to be the opposite of Module:start/2 and
