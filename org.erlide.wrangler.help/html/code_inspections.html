	<h1>Code Inspections</h1>
    <h2> Wrangler built-in code inspections </h2>	
    
	<h3><a name="Dependencies of a module">Dependencies of a module</a></h3>
		<p>Reports the names of modules that depend on the current module, as well as modules on which the 
		current module depends.</p>
		
	<h3><a name="Nested If Expressions">Nested <em> if </em> Expressions</a></h3>
	    <p> Reports all the functions that contain one or more ```if''' expressions that are 
	    nested the specified number of levels or more. </p>
	    <p> The whole project is searched if the 'Search in the project' option is selected, otherwise 
	    only the current Erlang module is searched. </p>
	    
	<h3><a name="Nested Case Expressions">Nested <em> case </em> Expressions</a></h3>
	    <p> Reports all the functions that contain one or more ```case''' expressions that are 
	    nested the specified number of levels or more. </p>
	    <p> The whole project is searched if the 'Search in the project' option is selected, otherwise 
	    only the current Erlang module is searched. </p>
	   
	 <h3><a name="Nested Receive Expressions">Nested <em> receive </em> Expressions</a></h3>
	    <p> Reports all the functions that contain one or more ```receive'' expressions that are 
	    nested the specified number of levels or more. </p>
	    <p> The whole project is searched if the 'Search in the project' option is selected, otherwise 
	    only the current Erlang module is searched. </p>
	    
	 <h3><a name="Long Functions">Long Functions</a></h3>
	    <p> Reports all the functions that has more than the specified number of lines of code, 
	    	not including comments and white lines.<p>
	    
	<h3><a name="Large Modules">Large Modules</a></h3>
	    <p> Reports all the modules that has more than the specified number of lines of code, not 
	        including comments and white lines.<p>
	
	<h3><a name="Generate Function Callgraph">Generate Function Callgraph</a></h3>
	    <p> Generates the function callgraph for the current module. Only functions that are defined in 
	        the current moudle are shown in the callgraph. </p>
	        
	<h3><a name="Generate Module Graph">Generate Module Graph</a></h3>
	    <p> Generates the module graph for the current Erlang project. The user can decide whether the edges 
	    between modules should be labelled with the functions called. </p>
	  
	<h3><a name="Cyclic Module Dependency">Cyclic Module Dependency</a></h3>
	    <p> Reports the cyclic module dependencies, if there is any, for the current Erlang project. </p>

    <h3><a name="Module Dependency via Only Internal Functions">Module Dependency via Only Internal Functions</a></h3>
	    <p> Reports the module dependencies in the current Erlang project that are introduced because of the export of 
	        functions that should be kept internal to its defining module according to Wrangler's analysis. </p>
	        
    <h3><a name="Show Non Tail-recursive Servers">Show Non Tail-recursive Servers</a></h3>
	    <p> The Erlang Programming Rules says: All servers must be tail-recursive, otherwise the server will 
	    	consume memory until the system runs out of it. This function reports server functions that are not tail-recursive. </p>
        <p> In Erlang, it is not a good practice to write a server function like this:</p>
 	<pre><code>	
        loop() ->
           receive
             {msg1, Msg1} -> 
                ...,
                loop();
             stop ->
                true;
             Other ->
                error_logger:log({error, {process_got_other, self(), Other}}),
                loop()
           end,
           io:format("Server going down").    </code> </pre>           
                 
       <p>The above is not tail-recursive. This is a correct solution:</p>
     <pre><code>
        loop() ->
           receive
             {msg1, Msg1} -> 
               ...,
               loop();
             stop ->
               io:format("Server going down");
             Other ->
               error_logger:log({error, {process_got_other, self(), Other}}),
               loop()
           end. 
      	</code></pre>

	<h3><a name="Incomplete Receive Patterns">Incomplete Receive Patterns</a></h3>
	<p> Reports functions which has a receive expression that does not flush unknown messages. </p>
	<p> The Erlang Programming Rules says: Every server should have an Other alternative in at least 
	    one receive statement. This is to avoid filling up message queues. Example: </p>	
	     <pre><code>	
           main_loop() ->
               receive
                 {msg1, Msg1} -> 
                    ...,
                    main_loop();
                 {msg2, Msg2} ->
                    ...,
                    main_loop();
                 Other -> % Flushes the message queue.
                   error_logger:error_msg(
                      "Error: Process ~w got unknown msg ~w~n.", 
                       [self(), Other]),
                   main_loop()
               end.
	  </code></pre>
