## I can't write comments or strings in Chinese (or other non-latin language)!
<a name='faq1'/>

This has been fixed for R1603+. We use the right default encoding according to the runtima and we detect the `coding` comments at the top of a file and use the right encoding for it. There might be issues if you have multiple projects in the workspace targeting different Erlang versions, use `coding` to fix them.
